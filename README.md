# Retinal-Vessel-Segmentation-using-U-net-and-Image GAN

Abstract

Medical image segmentation is an indispensable step for the identification of certain retinal vascular conditions. In this project, the main focus is on retinal vessel networks in order to provide ophthalmologists with samples where they can detect vision-related diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, atherosclerosis and hypertension that can cause issues such as blindness. By using fundoscopic images, the segmentation outputs were obtained from a U-net model built by us and compared with the segmented retinal vessel maps produced by using an existing Generative Adversarial Network. Our methods achieved a 0.849 ROC, 0.799 PR and a dice coefficient of 0.770 on the DRIVE dataset and a 0.792 ROC, 0.759 PR and a dice coefficient of 0.701 on the STARE dataset. We compared our baseline U-net with the state-of-the-art Image-GAN model.
